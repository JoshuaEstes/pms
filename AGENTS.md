# AGENTS

- Follow shell style used in this project: four-space indentation and POSIX-compatible syntax when possible.
- Use descriptive variable names; avoid single-letter names except for indexes.
- Run `shellcheck` on all modified shell scripts.
- If tests exist, run them and ensure each test method covers one execution path.
- Keep files you touch tidy by fixing typos or minor issues you encounter.
