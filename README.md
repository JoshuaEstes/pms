PMS allows you to manage your shell in a way to that helps decrease setup time
and increases your productivity. It has support for themes (change the way your
shell looks), plugins (adds functionality to your shell), and dotfile
management.

One of the best parts is, the PMS framework allows you to use the same
framework in different shells. Use zsh on your personal laptop, and use bash on
remote servers. Wanna try fish? Go ahead, try out different shells and see the
power of PMS ;)
