Installing is can be done quick and easy by using curl. The installation process
will not overwrite any files and will backup your current rc files.

# Using curl

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoshuaEstes/pms/master/scripts/install.sh)"
```

# Using wget

```
sh -c "$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoshuaEstes/pms/master/scripts/install.sh)"
```

# "Manual" Install

```
curl -Lo install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoshuaEstes/pms/master/scripts/install.sh
sh install.sh
```
