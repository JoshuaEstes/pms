# Themes

Themes will change how your shell looks. This will mostly just modify the command prompt to look pretty. Some themes may make modifications to things such as tmux, vim, etc. to make them appear a lot better.

## Preview Theme

```sh
pms theme preview [THEME]
```

## Switch to New Theme

```sh
pms theme switch [THEME]
```
